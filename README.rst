When creating a ``setup.py`` for a new project, do you find yourself always
writing the same block of code for parsing ``__version__`` from your project's
source?  Something like this?

::

    with open(join(dirname(__file__), 'package_name', '__init__.py')) as fp:
        for line in fp:
            m = re.search(r'^\s*__version__\s*=\s*([\'"])([^\'"]+)\1\s*$', line)
            if m:
                version = m.group(2)
                break
        else:
            raise RuntimeError('Unable to find own __version__ string')

    setup(
        version = version,
        ...
    )

Someone needs to put all that into a reusable package, am I right?  Well,
someone did, and this is that package.  It exports a single function that does
the above, perfect for importing into your ``setup.py``, and *(New in v0.2.0!)*
this package even lets you map Python variables to supported metadata fields
via your ``pyproject.toml``.

Installation
============
Just use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ (You have pip, right?) to install
``read_version``::

    pip install read_version

``read_version`` also has a ``toml`` extra that provides support for
reading configuration from ``pyproject.toml``.  Install it with::

    pip install 'read_version[toml]'


Usage
=====

The Functional Way
------------------

1. Install ``read_version`` in your development environment.

2. Add a ``pyproject.toml`` file to your project declaring ``read_version`` as
   a build dependency.  (This is needed so that other people can build your
   package from source; see `PEP 518
   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/>`_ for more information.)  The
   contents of the file should look like::

        [build-system]
        requires = [
            "read_version ~= 0.2.0",
            "setuptools",
            "wheel"
        ]
        build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

3. In your ``setup.py``, get rid of your boilerplate ``__version__``-finding
   code and replace it with::

        from read_version import read_version

        setup(
            version = read_version('packagename', '__init__.py'),
            ...
        )

4. Done!

The Declarative Way
-------------------

*New in version 0.2.0!*

1. Install ``read_version`` in your development environment with the ``toml``
   extra::

    pip install 'read_version[toml]'

   You will also need version 42.0.0 or later of ``setuptools``::

    pip install -U 'setuptools>=42'

2. Add a ``pyproject.toml`` file to your project declaring
   ``read_version[toml]`` as a build dependency and also requiring version
   42.0.0 or later of ``setuptools``.  The relevant section of the file should
   look like::

        [build-system]
        requires = [
            "read_version[toml] ~= 0.2.0",
            "setuptools >= 42.0.0",
            "wheel"
        ]
        build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

3. Get rid of your boilerplate ``__version__``-finding code in your
   ``setup.py``.  Instead, for each metadata field that you want to be read
   from a variable in a Python source file, add a table to your
   ``pyproject.toml`` file named "``tool.read_version.FIELD``", where ``FIELD``
   is replaced by the lowercase name of the field.  Supported fields are:

   - ``author``
   - ``author_email``
   - ``description`` (Note that this is the short description or summary, not
     the long description!)
   - ``keywords`` (It is recommended to use a list of strings as the value or
     else ``setuptools`` might mangle it)
   - ``license``
   - ``maintainer``
   - ``maintainer_email``
   - ``url``
   - ``version``

   (Tables with unsupported or unknown field names are ignored.)

   Each such table may contain the following keys:

   :path: *(Required)* The path to the source file containing the variable to
          read, relative to the project root; this may be given as either a
          forward-slash-separated path or as a list of path components
   :variable: The name of the Python variable to get the value from; defaults
              to ``"__version__"``
   :default: If the variable cannot be found in the source file, use the given
             value instead; if the variable cannot be found and ``default`` is
             not set, an error will occur

   Some example entries::

    # Set the project's version to the value of __version__ in packagename/__init__.py
    [tool.read_version.version]
    path = "packagename/__init__.py"

    # Set the project's author to the value of __author__ in packagename/about.py
    [tool.read_version.author]
    path = ["packagename", "about.py"]
    variable = "__author__"

    # Set the project's license to the value of LICENSE in packagename/about.py.
    # If the variable isn't found, set the license field to "Proprietary".
    [tool.read_version.license]
    path = ["packagename", "about.py"]
    variable = "LICENSE"
    default = "Proprietary"

4. Done!

API
===
``read_version`` exports a single function, also named ``read_version``, whose
signature is::

    read_version(*filepath, variable='__version__', default=NOTHING)

``read_version()`` takes one or more file path components pointing to a Python
source file to parse.  The path components will be joined together with
``os.path.join()``, and then, if the path isn't absolute, the path to the
directory containing the script calling ``read_version()`` will be prepended to
the path.  (No more ``join(dirname(__file__), ...)`` boilerplate needed!)
``read_version()`` then parses the given Python file and searches through the
parse tree for any assignments to a variable named ``__version__``, returning
the last value assigned.

The ``variable`` keyword argument can be set to the name of a variable other
than ``__version__`` to search for assignments to a different variable instead.

If no assignments to the variable are found, a ``ValueError`` is raised.  To
instead return a default value when this happens, set the ``default`` keyword
argument.


Restrictions
============
``read_variable`` only finds assignments that occur at the top level of the
module, outside of any blocks.

Only assignments of literal values are supported; assignments to the
searched-for variable involving more complicated expressions will cause an
error to be raised.
